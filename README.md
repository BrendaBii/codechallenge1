# Code Challenge - Week 1

## Challenge Description

- The first challenge was to write a program that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade according to the marks.

- The second challenge was to write a program that takes as input the speed of a car. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

- The third challenge was to write a program that would calculate the Payee Tax, NHIF, NSSF deductions and net salary of an employee. The user would input the basic salary and benefits of the employee.

## Project Setup

To launch these programs you would need:

- An internet browser of your choice installed. Chrome Browser comes highly recommended.

- To edit the files we recommend that you use Visual Studio Code.
